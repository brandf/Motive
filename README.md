# Motive

![Motive Logo](assets/images/Motive.png)

Motive is a novel platform designed for the exploration and benchmarking of Large Language Models (LLMs) through interactive, turn-based games. It provides a unique environment where AI (or human) players can engage in complex scenarios, fostering the generation of valuable training data and facilitating research into advanced AI capabilities like long-context reasoning, planning, and social engineering.

## Who is this for?

- **Players** who want to play the game (read the Manual)
- **Human contributors** building features and fixing bugs (read the Contributors guide)
- **AI coding agents** implementing code and tests (read AGENT.md)
- **Researchers** exploring LLM benchmarking and training data

## Quick Start

- **Players**: Read the [Game Manual](docs/MANUAL.md) first.
- **Contributors**: Start with [docs/CONTRIBUTORS.md](docs/CONTRIBUTORS.md) for setup, architecture, and workflows. See current priorities in [docs/TODO.md](docs/TODO.md).
- **AI Agents**: Follow the reading order in [docs/AGENT.md](docs/AGENT.md).
- **Vibe Coders**: See [docs/VIBECODER.md](docs/VIBECODER.md).

## Purpose of Motive

*   **Turn-Based Game with Chat Interface:** Motive enables the creation and execution of turn-based games with a chat-based interface. These games can be played by AI agents or human participants, with the potential for environments, characters, and objects to be dynamically balanced via AI simulation.

*   **LLM Benchmarking:** The platform is built to benchmark various LLMs by having them compete against each other. This includes evaluating generic pre-trained LLMs, Motive-fine-tuned models, and new architectural innovations.

*   **Training Data Generation:** Motive serves as a rich source of training data for future LLM development. It focuses on generating data with verifiable objectives, open-ended player-to-player communication, and tree rollouts, which are crucial for exploring long-context understanding, complex reasoning, intricate planning, and sophisticated social engineering tactics.

## What Makes Motive Unique

### Observability-Driven Gameplay
A central tenet of Motive is "observability." Player actions not only change the game state but also generate events that may or may not be observed by other players, leading to strategic social engineering and information asymmetry. This creates rich opportunities for:
- **Strategic deception** and misinformation
- **Alliance formation** and betrayal
- **Information warfare** and intelligence gathering
- **Complex multi-agent reasoning** about what others know

### Character-Driven Narrative
Each player is assigned a unique character with secret motives (win conditions). This creates:
- **Personal stakes** that drive engagement
- **Conflicting objectives** that generate tension
- **Roleplay opportunities** for personality development
- **Strategic depth** through motive compatibility/conflict analysis

### Verifiable Training Data Generation
Motive's gameplay engine enables complete introspection of game state at any turn, creating unprecedented opportunities for verifiable training data:
- **Ground truth availability** for every game state, action, and outcome
- **Question/answer pairs** with definitive answers based on actual game events
- **Causal reasoning validation** through step-by-step game state reconstruction
- **Social interaction verification** with complete conversation logs and context
- **Strategic decision analysis** with known outcomes and alternative paths
- **Tree-rollout datasets** enabling "game-multiverse" exploration from any decision point
- **Reinforcement learning support** through complete action-reward trajectories with verifiable outcomes

### LLM-Optimized Design
Motive is specifically designed for LLM players:
- **Structured action syntax** (`> move north`, `> whisper Player "hello"`)
- **Clear observability rules** for predictable information flow
- **Balanced action costs** that encourage strategic thinking
- **Rich logging** for training data generation

## Background

Motive draws inspiration from the rich history of text-based adventure games and Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs) that emerged in the 1970s and 1980s. These early interactive fiction games, like *Zork*, *Adventure*, and later MUDs such as *LambdaMOO* and *Achaea*, pioneered many concepts that Motive adapts for modern AI research:

### Historical Foundations

**Text Adventures (1970s-1980s)**: Games like *Colossal Cave Adventure* and *Zork* introduced players to interactive fiction through simple text commands (`go north`, `take sword`, `examine room`). These games emphasized exploration, puzzle-solving, and narrative discovery through pure text interaction.

**MUDs (1980s-1990s)**: Multi-User Dungeons expanded text adventures into persistent online worlds where multiple players could interact simultaneously. Games like *LambdaMOO*, *Achaea*, and *DragonMUD* introduced concepts like:
- **Social dynamics** between players
- **Character progression** and roleplay
- **Complex object interactions** and crafting systems
- **Player-versus-player** conflict and cooperation
- **Persistent world state** that evolved over time

### Modern Adaptation for AI Research

Motive takes these proven game design principles and reimagines them for Large Language Model benchmarking:

**From Human Players to AI Agents**: While traditional MUDs were designed for human players typing commands, Motive is optimized for LLM players that can engage in complex natural language interactions and strategic reasoning.

**From Real-Time to Turn-Based**: Classic MUDs operated in real-time, but Motive uses structured turn-based gameplay that allows for careful analysis of AI decision-making processes.

**From Entertainment to Research**: While historical games focused on entertainment, Motive serves as a controlled environment for studying AI capabilities like long-context reasoning, social engineering, and multi-agent coordination.

**From Manual Content to AI-Generated**: Traditional MUDs required extensive manual world-building, while Motive's architecture supports AI-assisted content generation and dynamic world creation.

This historical context helps explain why Motive's design choicesâ€”like structured action syntax, observability mechanics, and character-driven narrativesâ€”aren't arbitrary, but rather evolved solutions to challenges that game designers have been solving for decades.

> move tavern
GM: You enter the tavern. You see Elara the bard tuning her lute.
> whisper Elara "Do you know anything about the mayor?"
GM: Elara whispers back: "I've heard rumors about strange lights in the cemetery..."
```
