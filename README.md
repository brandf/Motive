# Motive

![Motive Logo](assets/images/Motive.png)

Motive is a novel platform designed for the exploration and benchmarking of Large Language Models (LLMs) through interactive, turn-based games. It provides a unique environment where AI (or human) players can engage in complex scenarios, fostering the generation of valuable training data and facilitating research into advanced AI capabilities like long-context reasoning, planning, and social engineering.

## Purpose of Motive

*   **Turn-Based Game with Chat Interface:** Motive enables the creation and execution of turn-based games with a chat-based interface. These games can be played by AI agents or human participants, with the potential for environments, characters, and objects to be dynamically balanced via AI simulation.

*   **LLM Benchmarking:** The platform is built to benchmark various LLMs by having them compete against each other. This includes evaluating generic pre-trained LLMs, Motive-fine-tuned models, and new architectural innovations.

*   **Training Data Generation:** Motive serves as a rich source of training data for future LLM development. It focuses on generating data with verifiable objectives, open-ended player-to-player communication, and tree rollouts, which are crucial for exploring long-context understanding, complex reasoning, intricate planning, and sophisticated social engineering tactics.

## What Makes Motive Unique

### Observability-Driven Gameplay
A central tenet of Motive is "observability." Player actions not only change the game state but also generate events that may or may not be observed by other players, leading to strategic social engineering and information asymmetry. This creates rich opportunities for:
- **Strategic deception** and misinformation
- **Alliance formation** and betrayal
- **Information warfare** and intelligence gathering
- **Complex multi-agent reasoning** about what others know

### Character-Driven Narrative
Each player is assigned a unique character with secret motives (win conditions). This creates:
- **Personal stakes** that drive engagement
- **Conflicting objectives** that generate tension
- **Roleplay opportunities** for personality development
- **Strategic depth** through motive compatibility/conflict analysis

### LLM-Optimized Design
Motive is specifically designed for LLM players:
- **Structured action syntax** (`> move north`, `> whisper Player "hello"`)
- **Clear observability rules** for predictable information flow
- **Balanced action costs** that encourage strategic thinking
- **Rich logging** for training data generation

## Current Status

### âœ… Implemented Features

- **Core Action System**: Movement, communication, inventory, and interaction actions
- **Hierarchical Configuration**: Flexible YAML-based game content organization
- **Observability System**: Event-driven information distribution
- **Inventory Constraints**: Realistic object interaction limitations
- **Training Data Pipeline**: Comprehensive tools for curating LLM training data
- **Theme/Edition System**: Modular content organization (core â†’ fantasy â†’ hearth_and_shadow)

### ðŸš§ In Development

- **Advanced Actions**: Give, trade, throw, use, and enhanced look actions
- **Help System Enhancement**: Detailed action-specific help
- **AI Prompting Improvements**: Better strategic gameplay guidance

### ðŸ“‹ Planned Features

- **Environment Generation**: Dynamic world creation and randomization
- **Advanced Object System**: State-dependent behavior and interactions
- **Inventory Visibility**: Hidden items and stash mechanics
- **Declarative Object Behavior**: When-condition based object interactions

## Game Examples

### Hearth and Shadow Edition
The current flagship edition features a fantasy town with:
- **11 interconnected rooms** (tavern, guild, church, bank, etc.)
- **5 unique characters** with complex motives and backstories
- **Strategic connections** including hidden passages and secret tunnels
- **Rich object interactions** with story-driven items and tools

### Sample Gameplay
```
Player: I need to find information about the mayor's disappearance.
> look
GM: You're in the town square. You see a message board, the tavern, and the church.
> move tavern
GM: You enter the tavern. You see Elara the bard tuning her lute.
> whisper Elara "Do you know anything about the mayor?"
GM: Elara whispers back: "I've heard rumors about strange lights in the cemetery..."
```
