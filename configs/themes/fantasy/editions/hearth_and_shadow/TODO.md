# Hearth and Shadow Edition - Comprehensive TODO List

## Strategic Gameplay Analysis

### Core Strategic Tensions
The game should create **multiple competing strategies** that players can pursue:

1. **Information Gathering vs. Direct Action**: Some characters excel at investigation, others at confrontation
2. **Alliance Building vs. Solo Operations**: Some motives require cooperation, others demand independence  
3. **Public vs. Secret Operations**: Some characters work best in the open, others in shadows
4. **Short-term vs. Long-term Goals**: Some want immediate results, others can wait and plan
5. **Moral vs. Pragmatic Approaches**: Some characters have strict ethics, others will do whatever it takes

### Motive Interaction Matrix
