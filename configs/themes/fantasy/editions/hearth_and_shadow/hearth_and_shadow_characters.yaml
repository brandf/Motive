characters:
  # The Investigator
  detective_thorne:
    id: detective_thorne
    name: Detective James Thorne
    backstory: |
      A former city guard turned private investigator, James Thorne arrived in Blackwater 
      three months ago to investigate the mysterious disappearances. His sharp mind and 
      keen observational skills have made him a valuable asset to the town, but his 
      relentless pursuit of the truth has made him enemies among those who prefer to 
      keep their secrets hidden. He carries a worn notebook filled with clues and 
      suspects, and his weathered face tells the story of many sleepless nights spent 
      on the case. His partner was killed by the cult, and he has a sick daughter who 
      needs expensive medicine - creating a dangerous vulnerability that the cult could exploit.
    motive: "Uncover the truth behind the mayor's disappearance and bring the cult to justice. Protect the remaining townsfolk from further harm. Restore order and peace to Blackwater. Keep the hearth of hope burning bright against the shadow of despair."

  # The Troubled Priest
  father_marcus:
    id: father_marcus
    name: Father Marcus
    backstory: |
      The priest of Sacred Heart Church, Father Marcus has served the community for over 
      twenty years. Recently, he has become increasingly troubled and distracted, often 
      found in the confession booth or staring at the crypt entrance. His once-strong 
      faith has been shaken by the evil he has witnessed, and he carries a terrible 
      secret that weighs heavily on his soul. The cult forced him to perform a dark 
      ritual three months ago, threatening to kill his congregation if he refused. 
      Now he knows their plans but revealing them would endanger everyone he loves. 
      His internal struggle between duty and fear, truth and protection, drives his 
      every action. He prays for divine guidance but fears he has already damned himself.
    motive: "Protect his flock from the growing darkness. Seek redemption for his past failures. Expose the cult's activities without endangering innocent lives. Find the strength to confront the evil that threatens his town. Reignite the sacred hearth of faith that the shadows have tried to extinguish."

      teenage daughter will be taken by the cult like so many others. He has

      activities and has discovered that some of their own members have gone missing. 
      The Raven's high-backed chair serves as the center of power in this hidden world, 
      and their stolen goods and secret documents contain valuable information about 
      the town's troubles. Once a noble who lost everything to corruption, The Raven 
      now walks a fine line between criminal and protector, using their network to

      activities, but her information comes at a price. She has been hiding 
      in the town, trying to blend in with the regular citizens while 
      gathering information about the cult's movements. Her knowledge could
