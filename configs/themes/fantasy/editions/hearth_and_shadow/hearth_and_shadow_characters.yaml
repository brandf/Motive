  detective_thorne:
    id: detective_thorne
    name: Detective James Thorne
    backstory: |
      A former city guard turned private investigator, James Thorne arrived in Blackwater 
      three months ago to investigate the mysterious disappearances. His sharp mind and 
      keen observational skills have made him a valuable asset to the town, but his 
      relentless pursuit of the truth has made him enemies among those who prefer to 
      keep their secrets hidden. He carries a worn notebook filled with clues and 
      suspects, and his weathered face tells the story of many sleepless nights spent 
      on the case. His partner was killed by the cult, and he has a sick daughter who 
      needs expensive medicine - creating a dangerous vulnerability that the cult could exploit.

  # The Troubled Priest with multiple possible motives
  father_marcus:
    id: father_marcus
    name: Father Marcus
    backstory: |
      The priest of Sacred Heart Church, Father Marcus has served the community for over 
      twenty years. Recently, he has become increasingly troubled and distracted, often 
      found in the confession booth or staring at the crypt entrance. His once-strong 
      faith has been shaken by the evil he has witnessed, and he carries a terrible 
      secret that weighs heavily on his soul. The cult forced him to perform a dark 
      ritual three months ago, threatening to kill his congregation if he refused. 
      Now he knows their plans but revealing them would endanger everyone he loves. 
      His internal struggle between duty and fear, truth and protection, drives his 
      every action. He prays for divine guidance but fears he has already damned himself.
