      description: A weathered wooden board covered with missing person posters and
        town announcements. Recent postings suggest a pattern of disappearances that
        could be connected to your investigation. The notices mention that Father
        Marcus at the church has been investigating these disappearances and that
        there are rumors of cult activity in hidden locations around town. One notice
        specifically mentions that the cult's rituals are timed to celestial events.
        You can read or examine this board.

      text: '**CRIME SCENE EVIDENCE:**

        The earth has been recently disturbed in a circular pattern. Strange symbols
        are carved into the ground, still wet with what appears to be blood. The symbols
        appear to be some form of ritual marking.


        **FOOTPRINTS:** Multiple sets of footprints lead away from the site toward
        the Old Forest Path. The prints suggest 2-3 people were here recently, and
        one set appears to be dragging something heavy.


        **BLOOD ANALYSIS:** The blood appears fresh (less than 24 hours old) and there''s
        enough to suggest serious injury or worse.


        **RITUAL SYMBOLS:** The carved symbols match patterns seen in other parts
        of town, suggesting this is part of a larger cult ritual.
