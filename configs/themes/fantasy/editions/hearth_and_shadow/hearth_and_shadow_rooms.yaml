      description: "The heart of Blackwater, once bustling with merchants and travelers,\
        \ now feels empty and foreboding. \nA broken fountain sits in the center,\
        \ its water murky and still. Notice boards line the walls, \ncovered with\
        \ posters of missing persons. The cobblestones are cracked and worn, and the\
        \ air carries \nan unsettling chill. Shadows seem to move at the edges of\
        \ your vision, and the few remaining \ntownsfolk hurry past with worried expressions.\
        \ Yet in the center of the square, a small hearth \nstill burns - a symbol\
        \ of the town's stubborn hope that refuses to be extinguished by the growing\
        \ darkness.\n\nThe Town Hall stands imposing to the north, its doors slightly\
        \ ajar. To the east, the Blackwater Gazette office shows signs of recent activity\
        \ - journalists have been documenting the recent troubles. A small study to\
        \ the west belongs to the town's former astronomer, who was known for predicting\
        \ celestial events. Fresh evidence near the fountain suggests a recent struggle,\
        \ with bloodstains and strange markings that point to cult activity. The notice\
        \ board is covered with missing person posters, each one a potential lead\
        \ in your investigation.\n"

      description: 'A small study in the home of the town''s former astronomer, filled
        with star charts, astronomical instruments, and ancient texts about celestial
        phenomena. The room is cluttered but organized, with books and papers covering

        events, and his notes contain detailed information about the timing of various
        astronomical phenomena. This place holds the knowledge needed to understand
        when the cult''s rituals can be performed at their most powerful.

      description: 'A large stone mausoleum with ornate carvings and heavy stone doors
        that are slightly ajar. The interior is dimly lit by flickering candles, casting
        dancing shadows across the stone walls. Ancient sarcophagi line the walls,
        and the air is thick with the scent of old stone and incense. The mausoleum
        serves as both a resting place for the town''s founders and a secret meeting
        place for those who prefer to operate in shadows.


        **EXITS:** You can see the way back to the **cemetery** (graveyard).


        Ancient sarcophagi contain the remains of the town''s founders, each with
        their own story. Flickering candles suggest recent activity - someone has
        been here recently. Stone carvings on the walls tell the history of the town
        and its founding families. The air feels charged with ancient magic, suggesting
        this place has been used for rituals.
