      description: "The heart of Blackwater, once bustling with merchants and travelers,\
        \ now feels empty and foreboding. \nA broken fountain sits in the center,\
        \ its water murky and still. Notice boards line the walls, \ncovered with\
        \ posters of missing persons. The cobblestones are cracked and worn, and the\
        \ air carries \nan unsettling chill. Shadows seem to move at the edges of\
        \ your vision, and the few remaining \ntownsfolk hurry past with worried expressions.\
        \ Yet in the center of the square, a small hearth \nstill burns - a symbol\
        \ of the town's stubborn hope that refuses to be extinguished by the growing\
        \ darkness.\n\nThe Town Hall stands imposing to the north, its doors slightly\
        \ ajar. To the east, the Blackwater Gazette office shows signs of recent activity\
        \ - journalists have been documenting the recent troubles. A small study to\
        \ the west belongs to the town's former astronomer, who was known for predicting\
        \ celestial events. Fresh evidence near the fountain suggests a recent struggle,\
        \ with bloodstains and strange markings that point to cult activity. The notice\
        \ board is covered with missing person posters, each one a potential lead\
        \ in your investigation.\n\n**INVESTIGATION NOTE:** For detectives investigating cult activities, Father Marcus at the Sacred Heart Church has been gathering evidence and witness testimony. The church may contain crucial information about cult operations.\n"

        ancient texts about celestial alignments are scattered on tables. This place
        was used by the town''s original founders to study the stars, but it also
        holds clues about the cult''s timing and rituals. The view of the night sky
        is breathtaking, but there''s something ominous about the way the stars seem
        to align.

        The mayor''s office is empty, his chair pushed back as if he left in a hurry.
        Filing cabinets line the walls, filled with town records, birth certificates,
        and other official documents. This place holds the town''s official history,
        including records of disappearances and suspicious activities that might be
        connected to the cult.


        The records mention that Father Marcus at Sacred Heart Church has been investigating
        these disappearances and that there are rumors of cult activity in hidden
        locations around town. One notice specifically mentions that the cult''s rituals
        are timed to celestial events, and there are references to an observatory
        in the hills where the town''s founders studied the stars.

        Ancient sarcophagi contain the remains of the town''s founders, each with
        their own story. Flickering candles suggest recent activity - someone has
        been here recently. Stone carvings on the walls tell the history of the town
        and its founding families. The air feels charged with ancient magic, suggesting
        this place has been used for rituals.
