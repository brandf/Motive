        \ posters of missing persons. The cobblestones are cracked and worn, and the\
        \ air carries \nan unsettling chill. Shadows seem to move at the edges of\
        \ your vision, and the few remaining \ntownsfolk hurry past with worried expressions.\
        \ Yet in the center of the square, a small hearth \nstill burns - a symbol\
        \ of the town's stubborn hope that refuses to be extinguished by the growing\
        \ darkness.\n"
