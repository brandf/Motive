**üë§ Character:**
You are Mayor Victoria Blackwater, The charismatic mayor who disappeared three months ago, leaving the town in chaos. 
She was secretly investigating the cult's infiltration of her own administration and 
was close to exposing them when she vanished. Her family has a long history in 
Blackwater, and she was beloved by the townspeople. She's been held captive by the 
cult, who hope to use her knowledge of the town's defenses and her influence over 
the people to further their dark plans. Her disappearance has left a power vacuum 
that the cult has been exploiting.


**üéØ Motive:**
Ensure the Blackwater family name isn't tarnished by the town's current state and preserve their honor.

**üè† Initial location:**
A beautiful stone church with tall stained glass windows that cast colorful light across the 
pews. The air is filled with the scent of incense and the sound of soft chanting. The priest, 
Father Marcus, seems troubled and distracted, often looking toward the crypt entrance. The 
altar is adorned with fresh flowers, but there's an underlying sense of unease. The church 
serves as both a place of worship and a refuge for those seeking sanctuary from the town's 
troubles.

  ‚Ä¢ Confession Booth
  ‚Ä¢ Crypt Entrance

an unsettling chill. Shadows seem to move at the edges of your vision, and the few remaining

  - You move to the 'Market District'.
  - Destination: The commercial heart of Blackwater, where merchants once sold their wares to travelers from 
distant lands. Now, many stalls stand empty, and the few remaining merchants seem nervous 
and suspicious. The air is filled with the sounds of haggling and the smells of various 
goods, but there's an underlying tension that wasn't there before. The market serves as both 
a trading center and a gathering place for information and rumors.
 You also see: Merchant Stalls, Suspicious Merchants, Hidden Alleyways. Exits: Blackwater Bank, Adventurer's Guild Hall, Thieves' Den, Rusty Anchor Tavern, Town Square.
- ‚öîÔ∏è **Move Action:** (Cost: 10 AP, Remaining: 10 AP)
  - You move to the 'Town Square'.
  - Destination: The heart of Blackwater, once bustling with merchants and travelers, now feels empty and foreboding. 
A broken fountain sits in the center, its water murky and still. Notice boards line the walls, 
covered with posters of missing persons. The cobblestones are cracked and worn, and the air carries 
an unsettling chill. Shadows seem to move at the edges of your vision, and the few remaining 
townsfolk hurry past with worried expressions. Yet in the center of the square, a small hearth 
still burns - a symbol of the town's stubborn hope that refuses to be extinguished by the growing darkness.
 You also see: Notice Board, Broken Fountain, Town Statue, Cult Symbols, Fresh Evidence, Eternal Flame, Flame of Hope, Message Board, Town Crier. Exits: Rusty Anchor Tavern, Adventurer's Guild Hall, Sacred Heart Church, Blackwater Bank, Market District, Old Forest Path.
- ‚öîÔ∏è **Move Action:** (Cost: 10 AP, Remaining: 0 AP)
  - You move to the 'Sacred Heart Church'.
  - Destination: A beautiful stone church with tall stained glass windows that cast colorful light across the 
pews. The air is filled with the scent of incense and the sound of soft chanting. The priest, 
Father Marcus, seems troubled and distracted, often looking toward the crypt entrance. The 
altar is adorned with fresh flowers, but there's an underlying sense of unease. The church 
serves as both a place of worship and a refuge for those seeking sanctuary from the town's 
troubles.
 You also see: Confession Booth, Crypt Entrance, Cult Member's Confession, Hearth Stone. Exits: Town Square, Blackwater Cemetery.

the silence from father marcus is infuriating, and the crypt remains sealed despite the urgency of the cult's plans. i must focus on the crypt entrance itself, looking for any specific mechanism. then, i will try to force an interaction with the confession booth, and finally, try speaking directly to the crypt with the cult's name, hoping for a reaction.

> look "crypt entrance handle"
> move "confession booth"
> say "shadowed hand, i know your secrets! open this crypt!"
