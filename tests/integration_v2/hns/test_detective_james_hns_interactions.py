"""
Integration tests for Detective James Thorne motive chain in Hearth & Shadow using proper action design.

These tests verify:
1. Object interactions (look action on evidence objects)
2. Character interactions (talk action on witness characters)
3. Property tracking and motive progression
4. Template variable replacement in events
5. Complete motive chain workflow
