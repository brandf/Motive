"""
Integration tests for game flow to prevent manual placement and character assignment bugs.

These tests verify that:
1. Manual appears first in the first interaction
2. Clear separation "GAME BEGINS NOW" appears after manual
3. Character assignment comes after manual
4. Initial location comes after character assignment
5. No "Recent Events" section on first turn
