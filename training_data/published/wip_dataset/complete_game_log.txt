**Character:**
You are Hero, a Hero.

**Motive:**
Defeat the evil sorcerer.

Initial location: The heart of Blackwater, once bustling with merchants and travelers, now feels empty and foreboding. 
A broken fountain sits in the center, its water murky and still. Notice boards line the walls, 
covered with posters of missing persons. The cobblestones are cracked and worn, and the air carries 
an unsettling chill. Shadows seem to move at the edges of your vision, and the few remaining 
townsfolk hurry past with worried expressions. Yet in the center of the square, a small hearth 
still burns - a symbol of the town's stubborn hope that refuses to be extinguished by the growing darkness.


**Objects in the room:**
  • Notice Board
  • Broken Fountain
  • Town Statue
  • Cult Symbols
  • Fresh Evidence
  • Eternal Flame
  • Flame of Hope
  • Message Board
  • Town Crier

**Exits:**
  • Rusty Anchor Tavern
  • Adventurer's Guild Hall
  • Sacred Heart Church
